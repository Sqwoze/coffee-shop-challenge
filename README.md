# â˜• Coffee-Shop Challenge

The **Coffee-Shop Challenge** is a beginner-friendly Python project that uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to simulate a coffee shop system. It allows customers to place orders for different coffee types and tracks these orders to compute useful data such as total order count and average pricing.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project consists of three main models:

- **`Customer`**  
  Represents a person who can place coffee orders.

- **`Coffee`**  
  Represents a specific type of coffee available for order.

- **`Order`**  
  Connects a customer and a coffee with a price, representing a purchase.

### âœ… Key Features

- Create and manage **customers** and **coffees**
- Place **orders** with specific prices
- Retrieve all orders for a customer or a coffee
- View all coffees a customer has tried
- View all customers who have ordered a specific coffee
- Calculate:
  - Number of orders per coffee
  - Average price paid for each coffee
- ðŸ”¥ **Bonus**: Identify the customer who spent the most on a specific coffee

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**  
  Core programming language used to build the system.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  To structure code using classes, relationships, and encapsulation.

- **`unittest`** (Python Standard Library)  
  Used for writing and running unit tests to ensure correctness of each class and method.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Goals

This project is designed to help new Python learners:

- Understand how to design and use Python **classes**
- Practice creating and enforcing **properties** and **validation**
- Manage relationships between **objects**
- Write and run tests using **Python's `unittest` framework**

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- No external libraries required
- Recommended: Use a code editor like VS Code or PyCharm for easy navigation
